### Runtime configuration:

| Env var | Default | Options |
| ------- |-------- |---------|
|`DEPLOYMENT_ENV`    | dev     | "dev", "staging", "production" |


Differences in builds by environment:

| Target | Sources Maps | Uglification | NODE_ENV === 'production' |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |  ------------------------- |
| dev    | true         | false |  false                     |
| staging| true         | false |  false                      |
| production| false      | true |  true                      |

### Deployment
Once built, Webpack outputs (e.g., index.html, JS and CSS files) are put into a tar archive, gzipped, and stored in
Artifactory in the `maven-snapshot-local` repo. From there, deployments involve: a) pulling a particular artifact (referenced by git tag) out of Artifactory
and b) copying the contents of the artifact to an S3 website bucket. For both staging and production deployments, these 
steps are captured in this project's Jenkinsfile and can be executed by setting the proper parameters for the Jenkins build.

#### Staging deployment
Automatically builds from `main`

#### Production deployment
1. Make a new version: `npm version [patch/minor/major]`
2. Push the new package.json version: `git push origin main`
3. Push the new tag: `git push origin [NEW_TAG]`

### Docker image configuration
| Env var | Required | Default | Notes |
| ------- |-------- |---------|---------|
| `PORT` | - | 80 | Port on which the app will run **inside** the container. |
