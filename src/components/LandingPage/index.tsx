                    ​This project aims to involve the wider biology community,
                    especially wet lab biologists, in building and analyzing
                    spatial mechanistic simulations at different levels of scale
                    and connecting them in the context of whole cells. Our goal
                    is to facilitate collaboration between experimental and
                    computational biologists by building software tools and
                    infrastructure to allow easy access to software packages
                    written by computational biologists and easy visualization
                    and sharing of results.

                    We have begun by building initial models for nucleating
                    branched actin and growing microtubules as example systems,
                    using the software package ReaDDy to simulate
                    reaction-diffusion and dynamics and CytoSim to connect these
                    coarse-grained molecular models to larger scale filament
                    models of cytoskeletal networks. Our goal is to provide the
                    resulting multiscale models to the community as a starting
                    point for modeling their favorite aspect of cytoskeletal
                    systems via a user interface on the web or programmatically
                    through a python API. As we add more software packages and
                    models, our long-term goal is to support mechanistic
                    modeling of all cell systems at different levels of scale.

                    A visual user interface on a website allows biologists to
                    create computational biological models by dragging and
                    dropping components, either starting from scratch or reusing
                    components that others have built. When they’re ready, they
                    run their model and interact with the results in real time
                    by navigating through a 3D “video game” world full of the
                    cells and molecules they created. They pull up graphs and
                    charts and configure them to help understand the results.
                    When they want to share their findings with colleagues or
                    provide supplemental materials for their next paper, they
                    generate a link to their simulation playground where others
                    can change parameters and explore their conclusions.​

                    The backend application accepts inputs from this user
                    interface and sends them to existing 3rd party simulation
                    software packages for computation. As results are calculated
                    on the server, they are collected and sent back to the
                    viewport on the website so the user can see what is
                    happening in 3D space and create graphs and other data
                    visualizations. Computational biologists, who generally
                    create these kinds of simulations by writing custom
                    software, can upload the results of their simulations
                    directly to the web viewport so they can easily be explored
                    and shared, and also can contribute their software package
                    as a 3rd party simulation engine.

                    Educators can peruse a library of simulations these
                    researchers have published and use them to build interactive
                    activities for their students. If you change the rate of a
                    reaction, how does that affect the outcome of the
                    simulation? These activities can be contributed back to a
                    library that other educators can use. Some of these
                    activities could also be published alongside news articles
                    for the general public to explore.
