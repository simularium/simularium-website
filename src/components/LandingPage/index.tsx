                        The Simularium Viewer makes it easy to share and
                        interrogate interactive 3D visualizations of biological
                        simulation trajectories and related plots directly in a
                        web browser. Its primary goal is to facilitate
                        collaborations among experimental and computational
                        biologists by removing major challenges to sharing,
                        accessing, and comparing simulation results.
