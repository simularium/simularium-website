                        Simularium makes it easy to share and analyze spatial
                        simulations directly in a web browser. Its major goal is
                        to facilitate collaborations between experimental
                        biologists and computational biologists by removing
                        major challenges to accessing, running, sharing, and
                        analyzing simulation results.

                        the modified simulations on the cloud, and to analyze

                        plan to wrap several published packages that can serve
                        as templates for community development and to encourage

                        simulations and the various simulation engines that
                        generated them for use in building an integrated,
                        mechanistic understanding of human cells. We will also
                        work with educators at all levels of science teaching to
                        integrate and test Simulariumâ€™s potential for use in
